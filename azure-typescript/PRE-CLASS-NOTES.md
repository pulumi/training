# Pre Class Notes
To ensure the most efficient use of workshop time, each student should go through the following steps to set up the environment to use for the workshop.

## Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have the latest version of the pulumi cli installed  
(see: https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)

1. Make sure you have access to a Pulumi account, run `pulumi login`
1. Make sure you have access to an Azure account, run `az login`

## Set Up Workshop Environments
This will install the base workshop code and related typescript packages

1. `mkdir azure-typescript-workshop && cd azure-typescript-workshop`

**NOTE:** When running `pulumi new` below, if you are going to use your Pulumi organization account instead of your personal Pulumi account, use `YOUR-ORGANIZATION-NAME/YOUR-NAME` when prompted for a stack name. This will create the stack in your organization and by using your name will avoid stack naming conflicts.

2. `mkdir stack-basics && cd stack-basics`
3. `pulumi new https://github.com/pulumi/training/tree/main/azure-typescript/1_stack-basics`
4. `cd ..`
5. `mkdir stack-advanced-topcs && cd stack-advanced-topics`
6. `pulumi new https://github.com/pulumi/training/tree/main/azure-typescript/2_stack-advanced-topcs`
7. `cd ..`
8. `mkdir component-resources && cd component-resources`
9. `pulumi new https://github.com/pulumi/training/tree/main/azure-typescript/3_component-resources`
10. `cd ..`
11. `mkdir stack-references && cd stack-references`
12. `pulumi new https://github.com/pulumi/training/tree/main/azure-typescript/3_component-resources`
