# Exercise 1: 
Create and use a configuration secret for the DB password, and create a stack output with the value.   
NOTE: The code as written now will fail since it requires a password config value.
The goal of this exercise is to address that by storing the password in the stack config as a secret and then using the value in the code.   
And, when any value that touched that secret is exported as a stack output, you will see that Pulumi will keep it as a secret.  
Furthermore, secrets are not displayed in logs or in the Pulumi Console (SaaS).  
VALIDATION: Look at the stack config file and see that the password is stored as encrypted data.

# Exercise 2: 
The project also outputs the resource group name in clear text.
Let's programatically set the resource group name as a secret.

# Exercise 3: 
Create a URL with the `appHostName` and make it an output.  
Bonus: Solve this in two ways.  
Hint: The value of `appHostName` is not known until after deployment. So it's an "Output<T>" type.

# Exercise 4: 
Make the code more modular and readable by moving config and related set up to it's own file and move the helper function to it's own file.
Hint: This is simply using standard C# approaches to putting code blocks in separate files, be imported into the main program and referenced accordingly.
